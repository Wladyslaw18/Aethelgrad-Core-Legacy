Can you hear the silence?
// first time modding be like, confidence at 100 //

Can you see the dark?
// content log opened, hope immediately gone //

Can you fix the broken?
// Mojang can (they choose not to) //

Can you feel—can you feel my heart?
// first runtime error, emotional damage unlocked //

Can you help the hopeless?
// API docs say “experimental” like it’s a warning label //

Well, I’m begging on my knees
// to Mojang, respectfully, desperately //

Can you save my bastard soul?
// this world has seen too many reloads //

Will you wait for me?
// until the next minor version (spoiler: no) //

I’m sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
// old scripts sacrificed during refactors //

Forgive me, father, I love you, mother
// actual JS and TypeScript, innocent the whole time //

Can you hear the silence?
// the logs say absolutely nothing //

Can you see the dark?
// trillion gazillion errors, zero explanations //

Can you fix the broken?
// nah, working as intended //

Can you feel my heart?
// aka my code trying its best //

Can you feel my heart?
// runtime says: undefined //

I’m scared to get close, and I hate being alone
// touching the Bedrock API feels personal now //

I long for that feeling to not feel at all
// console.warn spam as a coping mechanism //

The higher I get, the lower I’ll sink
// abstractions built, sanity lost //

I can’t drown my demons, they know how to swim
// engine bugs shipped in the next update //

I’m scared to get close, and I hate being alone
// reload world = subscriptions duplicated //

I long for that feeling to not feel at all
// fresh test world gaslighting me into hope //

The higher I get, the lower I’ll sink
// ceiling hit, not skill issue //

I can’t drown my demons, they know how to swim
// they’re called “regressions” now //

I’m scared to get close, and I hate being alone
// yeah don’t touch the Bedrock API too hard or it’ll say “he touched me!!” //

I long for that feeling to not feel at all
// downgrade API, it magically works //

The higher I get, the lower I’ll sink
// not true — the engine just stops you //

I can’t drown my demons, they know how to swim
// and they’re documented nowhere //

Can you feel my heart?
// what I tried to build with JS //

Can you hear the silence?
// logging exists only in theory //

Can you see the dark?
// trillion gazillion errors, again //

Can you fix the broken?
// nah //

Can you feel—can you feel my heart?
// my code, screaming quietly //
