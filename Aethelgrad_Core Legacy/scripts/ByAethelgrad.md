This project was built from scratch for a private server.

It avoids marketplace dependencies, paid mechanics, and artificial restrictions.
Everything here is plain script you can read, change, or remove.

If this saves you time, use it.
If it doesn’t fit your server, strip it for parts.

This is intentional.
